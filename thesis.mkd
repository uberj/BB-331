Patents that protect the invenstement of buisnesses reasearching genomic medicine, desease detection and desease prevention help motivate innovation. Policies that prevent the use of those patents to hinder other reasearchers are just as important as the original patents themselves. Companies that are soley in the buisness of using patents to sue other companies are known as patent trolls and can scare reasearchers and investors out of putting in effort to advance a
technological field.
